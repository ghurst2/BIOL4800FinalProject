The 2ndDraft.py has a while loop that decreases the confidence of the short read overlap. 

for example:
the it would first look for and overlab of 13 bp then match those. Once it can no longer match it goes down to 12 etc.

Still need to:
-add spaces/gaps if there are multiple matches
-get the 2ndDraft.py to work fully.
    -only works with 3 lines not sure how to make it work with multiple lines
-it matches the last bp of first line with other the first bp of lines, 
need to write is so that if matches the first bp of the firstline with the last bp of other lines.
