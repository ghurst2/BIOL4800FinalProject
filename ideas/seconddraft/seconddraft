The second draft has a while loop that decreases the confidence of the short read overlap. 

for example:
the it would first look for and overlab of 13 bp then match those. Once it can no longer match it goes down to 12 etc.

Still need to:
-add spaces/gaps if there are multiple matches
-get the second draft to work fully
